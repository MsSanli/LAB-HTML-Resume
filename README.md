- Each article should have its own id.
- Each article should contain at least one section that describes your position there.

### CSS
- Each article should use a different font family.
- All article headings should be the same font color (don't be boring).
- Site should have a background color or background image. Images google filtered for "Royalty Free"
- Each article should have a different border(weight,style,color).

NOTE: If you have less than two previous employers, either use your educational instituions as a substitute or make them up.
